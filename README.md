    <h1>Vaccine Prediction Project Overview</h1>
    <div class="section-title">Objective</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood that individuals will receive the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. We aim to predict two probabilities for each individual: one for the xyz vaccine and one for the seasonal vaccine. This is a multilabel classification problem, and the performance metric is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) for each target variable.
    </div>
    <div class="section-title">Methodology</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <div class="section-title">1. Data Preprocessing</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            Data preprocessing involves loading the datasets, cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Features and labels are merged based on the respondent ID, and any missing values are filled using the mode of the respective columns. One-hot encoding is used to convert categorical features into numerical format. The processed data is then split into training and testing sets. Standardization is applied to ensure all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps improve the performance of many machine learning models.
        </div>
        <div class="section-title">2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            Exploratory Data Analysis is performed using a Jupyter notebook. This step involves visualizing the distributions of the target variables (xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine) and other features. Correlation matrices are plotted to identify relationships between features and the target variables. EDA helps in understanding the data and provides insights that can inform feature selection and engineering.
        </div>
        <div class="section-title">3. Model Training</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            The processed training data is used to train a machine learning model. An XGBoost classifier is chosen for its robustness and performance in classification tasks. The model is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated using the ROC AUC score on the validation set. The ROC AUC score measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes and is used as the primary metric for this multilabel classification problem.
        </div>
        <div class="section-title">4. Prediction</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            The trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data (test_set_features.csv). The same preprocessing steps applied to the training data are applied to the test data. The model outputs probabilities for each individual receiving the xyz and seasonal vaccines. These probabilities are saved in the required submission format.
        </div>
        <div class="section-title">5. Evaluation</div>
        <div class="section-content">
            The model's performance is further evaluated by comparing its predictions to true labels using the ROC AUC score. This evaluation ensures that the model generalizes well to new data and maintains high performance.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-title">Tools and Libraries</div>

            <li>Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.</li>
            <li>Scikit-learn: For preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.</li>
            <li>XGBoost: For training the classifier.</li>

    <div class="section-title">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        This structured approach ensures a clear and reproducible workflow for the machine learning project. By following these steps, we can effectively preprocess data, train a robust model, and make accurate predictions on the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. The use of the ROC AUC score as the evaluation metric ensures that the model's performance is reliably assessed.
